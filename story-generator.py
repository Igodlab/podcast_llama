# The test file as a "Fabula de sopo"
test_file = """The Eagle, the Hare, and the Beetle
A hare was being chased by an eagle, and seeing herself lost, she begged a beetle for help, pleading for its assistance.
The beetle asked the eagle to spare his friend. But the eagle, despising the insignificance of the beetle, devoured the hare in his presence.
From then on, seeking revenge, the beetle observed the places where the eagle laid its eggs, and rolling them, knocked them to the ground. Seeing herself driven away from wherever she went, the eagle turned to Zeus asking for a safe place to lay her eggs.
Zeus offered to let her place them in his lap, but the beetle, seeing this escape tactic, made a small ball of dung, flew up and dropped it on Zeus's lap.
Zeus then stood up to shake off that filth, and unknowingly threw the eggs to the ground. That is why since then, eagles do not lay eggs during the season when beetles come out to fly.
Moral: Never despise what seems insignificant, for there is no being so weak that it cannot reach you."""
